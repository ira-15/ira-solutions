                    Our Story & Mission
                </h1>
                <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        Every great story begins with a small realization. Ours began with something many people experience every day: the frustration of finding the right product for their home. Too often, we came across stands and accessories that looked good in pictures but weren’t practical. They needed drilling, extra tools, or permanent changes to walls, things that renters and even many homeowners hesitate to do. We asked ourselves: Why should good design come with so much inconvenience?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This question became the spark that lit our journey. In 2025, in the vibrant city of Pune, we decided to rethink what everyday products could be. We envisioned a line of artistic metal stands and accessories that combined three things: utility, beauty, and simplicity. Products that anyone could use without stress. Products that respected people’s spaces. Products that solved real problems while adding a sense of elegance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Our mission was clear: to create people-centric, renter-friendly, non-invasive solutions that enhance everyday living. From the start, we believed that good design is not only about how something looks, but also about how it feels to use and how seamlessly it fits into daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we began crafting, another truth became equally important to us: design should be accessible to everyone. That is why affordability became a cornerstone of what we do. We wanted our products to carry the grace of design without the burden of high prices. For us, beauty and function belong in every home, not just a select few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But our story is bigger than just our own products. Along the way, we realized we had an opportunity to make an even deeper impact by bringing the work of village artisans and local industries to modern households. India’s villages are filled with incredible craftsmanship, passed down through generations, yet many artisans struggle to find fair recognition and value for their work. By collaborating with them, we not only celebrate their artistry but also give them the platform and fair compensation they deserve. Every time you choose one of these products, you are not just buying something for your home, you are also supporting a legacy, a family, and a community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What started as a mission to solve simple, everyday problems has grown into something much greater: a movement to connect people, homes, and traditions. Today, we continue to design and curate with one guiding principle: products should make life easier, not harder. Whether it is a stand that saves you space, an accessory that blends function with design, or an artisan craft that brings warmth and authenticity to your home, everything we offer carries this philosophy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For us, this journey is about more than business. It is about trust, care, and connection. It is about creating products that respect the people who use them, the artisans who make them, and the spaces they live in.
